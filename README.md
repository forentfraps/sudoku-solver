# Sudoku recursive solver in python

## Few words about the project

### The original idea was to implement a collection of "fair" methods. However, it turned out to be completely impractical and non-trivial, although results were promising, I decided to do a simple recursive solution. Inspiration was drawn from a paper explaining wave function collapse, thus the collapse function looks over engineered. 


## Some description

### Code is (obviously) capable of solving any possible sudoku arrangement. For easier use, user is advised to import via the test.txt (better explained in the __init__ ()). As an example I found the most difficult sudoku (it is in the test.txt already). I will also use my ability to post some screenshots :-)
