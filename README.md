# Sudoku recursive solver in python

## The original idea was to implement a collection of "fair" methods. However, it turned out to be completely impractical and non-trivial, although results were promising ## I decided to do a simple recursive solution. Inspiration was drawn from a paper explaining wave function collapse, thus the collapse function looks over engineered.
