# Sudoku recursive solver in python

## The original idea was to implement a collection of "fair" methods. However, it turned out to be completely impractical and non-trivial, although results were promising  I decided to do a simple recursive solution. Inspiration was drawn from a paper explaining wave function collapse, thus the collapse function looks over engineered. 

## Code is (obviously) capable of solving any possible sudoku arrangement. For easier use, user is advised to import via the test.txt (better explained in the __init__()). As an example I found the most difficult sudoku (it is in the test.txt already). I will also use my ability to post some screenshots :-)

# P.S. PowerShell supports coloured output (unlike cmd)
